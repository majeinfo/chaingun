# Playbook  Syntax

The test script are described using the following YAML syntax.
(please note, that wrong parameter names ARE NOT detected by the YAML parser)

First of all, you define some global parameters (the count of iterations, the number of virtual users (VU)
to inject, etc...). Then you can define some default value for common parameters, you can also add your own
variables. At last, you define the list of actions to be performed by `chaingun`.

## Global Parameters

| Name | Value | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---        | 
| `iterations` | integer | (mandatory) indicates how many times each VU must play the script. If value is -1, the script is played until the value of `duration` parameter is reached |
| `duration`   | integer | (mandatory if `iteration` equals -1) gives the duration of the script playing in seconds |
| `rampup`     | integer | (mandatory) gives the time in seconds that is use to launch the VU. New VUs are equally launched during this period. |
| `users`      | integer | (mandatory) number of VUs to launch during the `rampup` period. For example, if `users` value equals 100 and `rampup` equals 20, 5 new VUs will be launched every new seconds (because 20*5 = 100) |
| `timeout`    | integer | (default=10) number of seconds before a network timeout occurs |
| `on_error`   | string  | (default=continue,stop_iteration,stop_vu,stop_test) define the behaviour for error handling: just display the error and continue (default), or abort the current iteration, or stop the current VU, or abort the whole test |
| `http_error_code` | list | (no default value) define the list of what is considered an HTTP error code. For example, `http_error_code: 404,403,500`. This is only used by HTTP Actions |


## Variables

Actions can define expressions that may contain variables. Some variables are created by `chaingun` but you can define and use your own variables.
You define your custom variables like this:

```
variables:
  variable_name: value
  ...
```

## Default value for Actions

Default values for some parameters of further Actions can be defined like this:

```
default:
  parameter_name: value
  ...
```

The supported parameter_name(s) are:

| Name | Description | Example values |
| :--- | :---:       | :--- |
| `server`   | name of remoter server - may also specify a port | www.google.com:80 or www.bing.com |
| `protocol` | protocol to be used | http or https |
| `method`   [ HTTP method to use | GET or POST |

```
---
iterations: 2		# MAND
duration: 100		# MAND if iterations == -1. Time is in seconds
rampup: 4		# MAND - time is in seconds
users: 2		# MAND - number of VU to launch during the rampup period
timeout: 10		# default value (in seconds)
on_error: continue	# (default) or stop_iteration | stop_vu | stop_test
http_error_codes: 404,403,500	# if set, these HTTP response codes generates errors

default:
  server: www.google.com:80     # port number is optional
  protocol: http                # could be https
  method: GET

variables:		# You can define here variables that can be reused later
  customer: bob
  amount: 1000

feeder:			# Only one Feeder can be defined
  type: csv		# MAND - csv if the only supported type
  filename: data1.csv	# MAND - the first line gives the column names and so the variable names
  separator: ","	# MAND

actions:
  # A simple GET

      # name of Cookie to store. __all__ catches all cookies !
      storeCookie: __all__

  # Wait 
  - sleep:
      duration: 500			# MAND - time is in milli-seconds

      # notes on expressions:
      # variable interpolation is possible, supported returned types are
      # int, string and bool (floats are converted into ints)
      # supported operators are described here:
      #   https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate/blob/master/MANUAL.md
      # supported functions are:
      # - strlen(string)
      # - substr(string, start, end)

  # Assertion are possible and use the same syntax as "setvar"
  - assert:
      expression: "name == \"bob\""

      # if the assertion fails, the action returns an error

  # Each action can be conditioned by a "when" clause that must be true to trigger the action
  - log:
      message: "something..."
      when: "var1 > 0"
```

The syntax for jsonpath is available at https://github.com/JumboInteractiveLimited/jsonpath.
