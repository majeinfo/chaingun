# Playbook  Syntax

The test script are described using the following YAML syntax.
(please note, that wrong parameter names ARE NOT detected by the YAML parser)

First of all, you define some global parameters (the count of iterations, the number of virtual users (VU)
to inject, etc...). Then you can define some default value for common parameters, you can also add your own
variables. At last, you define the list of actions to be performed by `chaingun`.

# Global Parameters

| Name | Value | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---        | 
| `iterations` | integer | (mandatory) indicates how many times each VU must play the script. If value is -1, the script is played until the value of `duration` parameter is reached |
| `duration`   | integer | (mandatory if `iteration` equals -1) gives the duration of the script playing in seconds |
| `rampup`     | integer | (mandatory) gives the time in seconds that is use to launch the VU. New VUs are equally launched during this period. |
| `users`      | integer | (mandatory) number of VUs to launch during the `rampup` period. For example, if `users` value equals 100 and `rampup` equals 20, 5 new VUs will be launched every new seconds (because 20*5 = 100) |
| `timeout`    | integer | (default=10) number of seconds before a network timeout occurs |
| `on_error`   | string  | (default=continue,stop_iteration,stop_vu,stop_test) define the behaviour for error handling: just display the error and continue (default), or abort the current iteration, or stop the current VU, or abort the whole test |
| `http_error_code` | list | (no default value) define the list of what is considered a HTTP error code. For example, `http_error_code: 404,403,500`. This is only used by HTTP Actions |


# Variables

Actions can define expressions that may contain variables. Some variables are created by `chaingun` but you can define and use your own variables.
You define your custom variables like this:

## Predefined Variables

| Parameter Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `HTTP_Response` | contains the HTTP returned code |

## User defined Variables

They are defined in the `variables` section:

```
variables:
  variable_name: value
  ...
```

# Default value for Actions

Default values for some parameters of further Actions can be defined like this:

```
default:
  parameter_name: value
  ...
```

The supported parameter_name(s) are:

| Name | Description | Example values |
| :--- | :---:       | :--- |
| `server`   | name of remoter server - may also specify a port | www.google.com:80 or www.bing.com |
| `protocol` | protocol to be used | http or https |
| `method`   | HTTP method to use | GET or POST |


# Actions and Pre-Actions

Actions and pre-actions are defined as a list under the `actions` and `pre_actions` key :

```
pre_actions:
  - action1 ...
  - action2 ...

actions:
  - action1 ...
  - action2 ...
```

Pre-Actions are played only once before starting the VUs.
Actions are played by the VUs.
In "batch" mode, only the first injector given on the command line will play the pre-actions.
Pre-actions are not still handled in "manager" mode.


Here is the list and the description of the implemented Actions :

## http : HTTP/S Request

| Parameter Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `title` | mandatory string that qualifies the request - used for the result output and logging |
| `method` | GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE. If absent use the value given by the `method` key in the default section |
| `url` | mandatory. If the string does not contain a server specification, use the value given by the `server` key in the default section |
| `storeCookie` | if set, indicates which cookies must be stored in the VU session. The predefined value __all__ implies the capture of all possible cookies |
| `body` | value of HTTP body (works for any HTTP method) (one of `body` or `template` is mandatory) |
| `template` | a filename which contents will be interpolated and will be used as the request body (one of `body` or `template` is mandatory) |
| `upload_file` | when used with the POST or PUT methods, indicates a file which contents will be sent to the server as-is (not implemented) |
| `headers` | additional HTTP headers to transmit. Each header has the form `header_name: value`. In case of a POST method, the body is sent with the HTTP Header `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | |
| `responses` | data can be extracted from server responses. The extraction can use the body or a HTTP Header. regex, jsonpath or xmlpath can be used to collect the substrings |


Examples:
```

# Advanced Topics

## Variables usage

Variables can be used in the following contexts :

in the following Action parameters, `http.url`, `http.body`, `mqtt.url`, `log.message`, `mqtt.url`, `mqtt.topic`, `mqtt.payload` 
In these cases, the variable names must be enclosed between `${....}`.

For example:

```
  - http:
      title: Page 3
      method: GET
      url: http://server/page3.php?name=${name}

  - log:
      message: Address value is ${address} (customer=${customer})

  # The HTTP_Response variable is always set after a HTTP action
  - log:
      message: HTTP return code=${HTTP_Response}
```

## Expressions

Expressions are strings that can contain scalar values (int, float, string, bool), standard operators and variables.
Variables are not surrounded by a `${...}`, they are named as is.

The evaluation of the expression must return an int, a string or a bool (floats are converted to ints)

The supported operators are described here:
   https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate/blob/master/MANUAL.md

The supported functions are:
 - strlen(string)
 - substr(string, start, end)

Examples:
```
  expression: "var1 + 3 > 4 * var2"
  expression: "strlen(var3) > 0"
```

## Session variables and Cookies

The session variables and the Cookies are deleted at the end of each script loop (if there are many) played by a VU.


## The `when` clause to trigger Actions

Each Action can be triggered by a `when` clause which defines an expression that must be evaluated to True to trigger the Action.

Example:
```
  - setvar:
      variable: xyz
      expression: "10 * delay"
    when: "delay > 2"
```

## How to import data from the outside

The `feeder` global section can be used to define an single source of external data. The following keys are mandatory :

| Key Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `type` | mandatory file type (only "csv" is supported) |
| `filename` | mandatory string that gives the filename |
| `separator` | mandatory string that gives the column separator |

The first line of the file must contain the column names. These names will be used to name the feeded variables !

Example :

```
feeder:
  type: csv
  filename: /path/to/data1.csv
  separator: ","
```

## Submit form using "multipart/form-data" syntax

You can use the `formdata` key to submit form fields encoded with `multipart/form-data`. This is necessary if
your form embeds a field of type `file`.

```
  - http:
      title: Page upload
      method: POST		# only for POST methods
      url: http://yourserver/a_page.php
      formdata:
        - name: name
          value: ${a_variable} Doe
        - name: fileToUpload
          value: a_filename.txt
          type: file		# mandatory for files
        - name: submit
```
